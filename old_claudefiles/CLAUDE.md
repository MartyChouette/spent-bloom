# CLAUDE.md — Project Context for Claude Code

## What Is This Project

Iris v3.0 is a contemplative flower-trimming game (thesis project). Unity 6.0.3, URP, C#. Players cut stems with scissors, evaluated against ideal rules for score and "days alive."

The game centers on an **apartment hub** — a direct pos/rot/FOV-lerp camera browses 3 areas (Kitchen, Living Room, Entrance). Items (books, records, perfumes, etc.) are hand-placed PlaceableObjects on FBX furniture — no procedural station builders. Managed by `ApartmentManager` (Browsing state only). The apartment model is imported from Blender (`aprtment blockout.obj`) at 0.1 scale.

## Build & Run

- **Engine:** Unity 6.0.3 with Universal Render Pipeline
- **Input:** New Input System (`com.unity.inputsystem 1.16.0`)
- **Camera:** Cinemachine 3.1.2
- **No CLI build** — open in Unity Editor, play in-editor

## Code Conventions

- **No namespace** on most scripts. Exceptions: `Iris.Camera`, `Iris.Apartment`, `DynamicMeshCutter`
- **Private fields:** `_camelCase`. **Static fields:** `s_camelCase`
- **Singletons:** Scene-scoped pattern (no DontDestroyOnLoad) — see `HorrorCameraManager`. Exceptions: `AudioManager`, `CaptionDisplay` use DontDestroyOnLoad
- **Static registries:** `private static readonly List<T> s_all = new(); public static IReadOnlyList<T> All => s_all;` with `OnEnable`/`OnDisable` add/remove. See `PlaceableObject`, `PlacementSurface`, `StemPieceMarker`, `ReactableTag`, `InteractableHighlight`
- **ScriptableObjects:** `[CreateAssetMenu]`, `[Header]`/`[Tooltip]` on all fields
- **Input:** Inline `InputAction` fallback when scene builder can't wire InputActionReferences (see `SimpleTestCharacter.cs`)
- **TMP text updates:** Use `TMP_Text.SetText()` with format args to avoid string allocation
- **Audio:** Always go through `AudioManager.Instance.PlaySFX(clip)` with null guards on both Instance and clip
- **Debug logs:** Prefixed `[ClassName]` — e.g. `[NewspaperManager]`
- **Editor scene builders:** Follow `ApartmentSceneBuilder.cs` pattern — `NewScene(EmptyScene)`, `CreateBox()` helper, URP Lit materials, `AssetDatabase.IsValidFolder()` checks

## Apartment Hub Architecture

```
ApartmentManager (Browsing only — single state)
       │ A/D input or click arrows
       ▼
Direct pos/rot/FOV lerp between 3 areas
       │
       ▼
All station managers always active (no StationRoot gating)
ObjectGrabber + CleaningManager + WateringManager always enabled
```

### Current Areas (3)

| Area | StationType | Notes |
|------|-------------|-------|
| Kitchen | DrinkMaking | Fridge gates DrinkMaking entry, phase-gated to DateInProgress |
| Living Room | None | Hand-placed books (BookItem), records (RecordItem), turntable (RecordSlot), perfumes, drawers |
| Entrance | None | Shoe rack, coat rack, front door |

### Key Components
- `ApartmentAreaDefinition` — ScriptableObject per area (cameraPosition, cameraRotation, cameraFOV, stationType)
- `StationRoot` — Exists in code but NOT wired by builder; all managers are always active, no station cameras
- `FridgeController` — Click-to-open fridge door that gates DrinkMaking station
- `CleaningManager` — Always enabled, raycasts from Camera.main on cleanableLayer
- `ObjectGrabber` — Spring-damper pick-and-place with `RaycastAll` surface detection (passes through nearer surfaces for cross-room placement). Routes held items to RecordSlot, DrawerController, DropZone before normal placement. Calls `BookItem.OnBookPickedUp()` on pickup.
- `BookItem` — Companion to PlaceableObject for books. References `BookDefinition`, optionally drops hidden item prefab on first pickup (day-gated via GameClock)
- `RecordItem` — Companion to PlaceableObject for vinyl records. References `RecordDefinition`
- `RecordSlot` — Scene-scoped singleton turntable receiver. Accepts `RecordItem` via ObjectGrabber, plays music via `AudioManager.PlayMusic`, feeds `MoodMachine "Music"` source, toggles `ReactableTag`. Public `Stop()` for phase transitions, `OnRecordChanged` event for `MidDateActionWatcher`
- `InteractableHighlight` — Toggle-based highlight overlay on hover using `Iris/Highlight` shader (flat fill + rim glow + pulse). Static registry (`InteractableHighlight.All`) enables highlight on any object (placeables, plants, etc.). Driven by `ApartmentManager` angular hover detection.

### Wall Dissolve / See-Through System

Walls use the `Iris/PSXLitDissolvable` shader which supports a `_DissolveAmount` property (0 = fully visible, 1 = fully dissolved). Three components work together:

```
WallOcclusionFader (scene-scoped singleton, LateUpdate)
    ├─ Raycasts from camera → date NPC, held object, area focus point
    ├─ Walls hit that use PSXLitDissolvable get _DissolveAmount driven up
    ├─ Respects dissolve "floor" from AreaWallFade / AlwaysFadedWall
    ├─ Exempts the farthest hit wall (the wall the target sits on) so wall items stay visible
    └─ Smooth fade in (0.2s) / fade out (0.4s) via MaterialPropertyBlock

AreaWallFade (per-wall component)
    └─ Array of { areaIndex, dissolveAmount } — dissolve floor per camera area
       e.g. Kitchen wall: areaIndex=0, dissolveAmount=0.85

AlwaysFadedWall (per-wall component)
    └─ Single BaseDissolve value — wall is always at least this dissolved
```

**How to make a wall see-through for a specific area:**
1. Assign **PSXLit_Dissovable** material (`Assets/Materials/PSXLit_Dissovable.mat`) to the wall renderer
2. Ensure the wall has a **collider** on the layer matching `WallOcclusionFader._wallLayer`
3. Add **AreaWallFade** component → add entry: area index (0=Kitchen, 1=Living Room, 2=Entrance), dissolve amount (0.85 = mostly invisible)
4. Ensure **WallOcclusionFader** exists in the scene (singleton on any GameObject)

**For always-dissolved walls** (e.g. isometric cutaway style): use **AlwaysFadedWall** instead of AreaWallFade, set `BaseDissolve` (e.g. 0.6).

**Files:** `WallOcclusionFader.cs`, `AreaWallFade.cs`, `AlwaysFadedWall.cs` in `Assets/Scripts/Apartment/`, shader `Assets/Shader/PSXLitDissolvable.shader`, material `Assets/Materials/PSXLit_Dissovable.mat`

### Camera Preset System

Compare different visual directions per area. Each preset is a `CameraPresetDefinition` SO (namespace `Iris.Apartment`).

```
CameraPresetDefinition (SO)
  └─ AreaCameraConfig[] (per area, index-matched to ApartmentManager.areas[])
       ├─ position, rotation          ← camera transform
       ├─ LensSettings lens           ← FOV, near/far, dutch, ortho, physical camera
       ├─ VolumeProfile               ← URP post-processing (color grading, bloom, DoF)
       ├─ lightIntensityMultiplier    ← scales directional light on top of MoodMachine
       └─ lightColorTint              ← tints directional light on top of MoodMachine
```

**Two-layer lighting:**
- Layer 1: `MoodMachine` (player actions → global mood → base light/ambient/fog/rain)
- Layer 2: Camera preset (`VolumeProfile` + light overrides → per-camera visual treatment)

**Controls:** `1`/`2`/`3` apply presets, backtick clears. Mouse parallax works on top of presets.

**Editor:** Select a preset SO → frustum wireframes in Scene View + "Capture Scene View" buttons per area.

**Files:** `CameraPresetDefinition.cs`, `CameraTestController.cs`, `CameraPresetDefinitionEditor.cs`

### Scene Builder Position Config

Newspaper layout is controlled by constants at top of `ApartmentSceneBuilder.cs` (lines 38-47):

| Constant | Default | Purpose |
|----------|---------|---------|
| `NewspaperCamPos` | (-5.5, 1.3, 3.0) | Read camera position |
| `NewspaperCamRot` | (5, 0, 0) | Read camera rotation (degrees) |
| `NewspaperCamFOV` | 48 | Read camera field of view |
| `NewspaperSurfacePos` | (-5.5, 1.1, 5.0) | Newspaper quad position |
| `NewspaperSurfaceScl` | (2.5, 1.75, 1) | Newspaper quad scale |
| `NewspaperCanvasOff` | (0, 0, 0.05) | Canvas offset from surface |
| `NewspaperCanvasScl` | 0.0025 | Canvas world-space scale |
| `NewspaperTossPos` | (-3.5, 0.42, 3.0) | Where newspaper lands after reading |
| `NewspaperTossRot` | (90, 10, 0) | Tossed newspaper rotation |

Station group positions (lines 30-32):

| Constant | Default | Purpose |
|----------|---------|---------|
| `DrinkMakingStationPos` | (-4, 0, -5.2) | Drink station in kitchen |

Bookcase and record player positions are retired — furniture is now hand-placed FBX models.

Edit these, then re-run **Window > Iris > Build Apartment Scene** to regenerate.

### Authored Mess System

Blueprint-driven mess spawning replaces the old random stain/trash system. Each mess is a `MessBlueprint` ScriptableObject with narrative conditions tied to date outcomes, flower trims, and day progression.

**Architecture:**
```
MessBlueprint (SO) — defines a single mess (stain or object)
    ├─ Identity: messName, description (flavor text)
    ├─ Classification: MessCategory (DateAftermath/OffScreen/General), MessType (Stain/Object)
    ├─ Conditions: requireDateSuccess/Failure, minAffection, requireReactionTag,
    │              requireBadFlowerTrim (<40), requireGoodFlowerTrim (>=80), minDay
    ├─ Placement: spawnPosition, spawnRotation, allowedAreas, weight
    ├─ Stain settings: SpillDefinition reference
    └─ Object settings: objectPrefab (or procedural box with objectScale/objectColor), canBeDishelved

AuthoredMessSpawner (scene-scoped singleton)
    ├─ Filters eligible blueprints by DateOutcomeCapture + GameClock day
    ├─ Weighted random selection (Fisher-Yates), up to _maxStainsPerDay / _maxObjectsPerDay
    ├─ Stains → moves pre-placed CleanableSurface slots to authored positions
    ├─ Objects → instantiates prefab or procedural box with PlaceableObject + ReactableTag
    └─ Called by DayPhaseManager during ExplorationTransition, or auto-spawns if no DPM

DailyMessSpawner (scene-scoped singleton)
    └─ Entrance item misplacement only (shoes, coat, hat to random wrong positions)
```

**Editor tools:**
- `MessBlueprintEditor` — custom inspector with condition summary, validation warnings, procedural preview, "Capture Position from Scene View" button, draggable scene gizmos (discs for stains, cubes for objects), color-coded by category (red=DateAftermath, blue=OffScreen, green=General)
- `MessEditorWindow` (`Window > Iris > Mess Editor`) — split-panel overview of all blueprints, filter by category/type/search, embedded inspector, toggleable scene gizmos, "New Mess Blueprint" button with category/type picker

**SOs:** `Assets/ScriptableObjects/Messes/` (15 blueprints — wine ring, lipstick smear, broken glass, muddy footprints, spilled coffee, wilted petals, petal debris, stem clippings, wilted leaves, etc.)

**How to edit which messes appear:**
1. **Window > Iris > Mess Editor** — overview of all blueprints, filter by category/type, click to edit inline
2. Or browse `Assets/ScriptableObjects/Messes/` and click any SO directly
3. To create new: right-click Project → `Create > Iris > Mess Blueprint`, or "New Mess Blueprint" in Mess Editor

**Condition fields on each MessBlueprint:**

| Field | Effect |
|-------|--------|
| `requireDateSuccess` | Only spawns after a successful date |
| `requireDateFailure` | Only spawns after a failed date |
| `minAffection` | Minimum affection score from date |
| `requireReactionTag` | Date must have reacted to this specific tag |
| `requireBadFlowerTrim` | Flower score < 40 |
| `requireGoodFlowerTrim` | Flower score >= 80 |
| `minDay` | Earliest day this mess can appear |
| `allowedAreas` | Which apartment areas it can spawn in |
| `weight` | Higher = more likely to be selected (weighted random) |

**Runtime:** `AuthoredMessSpawner` runs at day start (ExplorationTransition), filters all blueprints against `DateOutcomeCapture` + `GameClock.CurrentDay`, weighted random picks up to `_maxStainsPerDay` / `_maxObjectsPerDay`.

**Debug:** `ApartmentDebugPanel` (F3) — runtime overlay with grid snap slider, tidiness %, clock, mood readout.

## Vertical Slice — Full Game Flow

```
Menu → Tutorial Card → Name Entry (mirror) → Photo/Ad Intro → Newspaper
→ Preparation (timed) → Date (3 phases) → Couch Scene → Flower Trimming → End of Day
```

### 1. Menu → Start
- Main menu with start button
- Tutorial card shown between menu and game start (direct, explains controls)

### 2. Name Entry (Bathroom Mirror) — DEFERRED, separate scene added later
- Separate scene (hard cut). 3D "Nema" model in front of bathroom mirror, looping idle animation
- Text input for player name with **profanity filter** (block slurs / bad words)
- On confirm: camera takes a "photo" of Nema posing

### 3. Photo → Newspaper Intro
- Photo of Nema goes black & white
- Photo appears next to her personals ad in the newspaper
- Transition into the newspaper reading view

### 4. Newspaper (Morning Phase)
- **Visual:** Half-folded newspaper (cliche folded-in-half look), open to personals section
- **Layout:** 3 personal ads + 2 commercial ad slots per day
- Button-based ad selection — click a personal ad to choose your date
- Each of the 3 dates has unique preferences for apartment items, drinks, decor
- Scissors cutting mechanic preserved in code but not active (deferred)

### 5. Preparation Phase (Timed)
After selecting a date, a timer starts. The apartment starts messy (bottles, wine stains, possible blood stains from last night). Player prepares:

| Action | Station/System | Notes |
|--------|---------------|-------|
| Clean stains (wine, blood, trash, bottles) | CleaningManager | Sponge only (spray deferred) |
| Water plants | WateringManager | One-shot perfect pour mechanic (click timing) |
| Choose coffee table book | ObjectGrabber + BookItem | Grab book from shelf, place on coffee table for date to see |
| Choose vinyl record | ObjectGrabber + RecordSlot | Grab record from shelf, place on turntable to play |
| Spray perfume | PerfumeBottle | Changes hue, filter, weather, environment SFX via MoodMachine |
| Leave out items | DrawerController → shelf | Shelf display for date to react to |
| Choose outfit | **NEW: OutfitSelector** | Judged in date Phase 1 |

**End of prep:** Player calls on phone to start date early, OR timer expires and doorbell rings.

### 6. Date Phase 1 — Entrance (First Impressions)
Date NPC arrives at door. Three judgments with Sims-style thought bubble + emote + SFX:

1. **Outfit** — based on date's style preferences
2. **Perfume** — "What is that perfume?" reaction
3. **Welcome/greeting** — how player greets them

Each judgment: thought bubble appears → emote icon (heart/meh/frown) → SFX → affection ±

### 7. Date Phase 2 — Kitchen (Drink Making)
- Date stands by kitchen counter
- Player is given drink recipes (shown on HUD)
- **Select** correct alcohol bottle from shelf
- **Perfect pour** — one-shot click-timing mechanic (same as plant watering)
- Drink scored → date reacts with thought bubble
- If passed → proceed to Phase 3

### 8. Date Phase 3 — Living Room (Apartment Judging)
- Date takes their drink to living room
- Walks around, investigates key items (ReactableTags):
  - Coffee table book, vinyl playing, perfume scent, shelf items, cleanliness
- Each item: thought bubble → reaction → affection ±
- Phase ends after duration or all items investigated

### 9. Win/Lose Outcome
- **Win (score threshold met):** Couch cuddling scene — Nema and date on couch, Nema secretly holding scissors behind her back
- **Hard cut** to flower trimming scene
- Load flower, trim it, get score
- **End of Day 1**

### 10. Vertical Slice Notes
- Day 1 MUST start with a mess from previous night (pre-spawned stains, bottles, trash)
- Tutorial card at start is mandatory — direct instructions, not subtle
- This is a single-day vertical slice demonstrating the full loop
